# This is necessary to get matplotlib to run under mod-wsgi.
# On startup, it checks the write permissions of its config file;
# as of 0.98.3, it looks in $HOME for root instead of apache's home.
# This is most likely a problem with mod-wsgi, which can cause
# problems when using os module.
#
# In practice, Matplotlib does not actually write the configuration
# file to this location; it merely uses it to check whether it can.
# It corectly writes in ~www.
