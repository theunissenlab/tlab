Hi,

I have attached some matlab codes by Malcolm Slaney to invert spectrograms.  Basic idea is to estimate the phase (fine structure) for a given spectrogram profile by using an iterative projection method.  The main function is SpectrumInversion which calls the other three functions.


We also have some matlab codes to invert the "auditory spectrogram"
generated by our cochlear model.  The whole matlab package can be downloaded at http://www.isr.umd.edu/~speech/nsltools.tar.gz

Some references are listed below:

Hope it helps.
