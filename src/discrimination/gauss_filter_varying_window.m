function [Spikesfilt, Hwidth] = gauss_filter_varying_window(Spikes, Alpha_param, Kth_neigh, Fig)

% Function to smooth spike rasters with a gaussian window, with sd=sd to the kth neighbor, in order to obtain estimate of
% time varying firing rate.

% Requires:
% Spikes        is an n*t matrix with n the number of responses (trials)
%               obtained to the same stimulus presentation (can be one),
%               and t the number of time bins in ms. Spikes can also be the
%               PSTH or concatenated spike pattern obtained from several
%               presentations of the same stimulus.


% Optional Input parameters
% Alpha_param   Alpha_param corresponds to the Alpha parameter in the
%               gausswin function of matlab. It is defined as the
%               reciprocal of the standard deviation and is a measure of
%               the width of its Fourier Transform. As alpha_param
%               increases, the width of the window will decrease.
%               If omitted, alpha_param is 3. 

% Kth_neigh     is the neighbor spike that determine the width of the
%               gaussian window. Kth_neigh is vector of n floating points
%               (one value for each row in the matrix spikes). The
%               default neighbor is set to the first nearest neighbor (1).
%               Note that the best value is 1/2 number of trials for
%               concatenated spike patterns of ntrials.

% Fig           a logical flag to see intermediare and output figures.
%               Set to 1 by default.


% Returns:
% Spikesfilt    is the same size as spikes and is the gaussian filtered
%               output of Spikes


% Hwidth        a structure that contains three vectors of length the number
%               of bins containing at least one spike in the input matrix Spikes.
%                       Hwidth.trial is the row/trial ID of the bin
%                       Hwidth.timebin is the time bin position of each
%                       bin containing at least a spike
%                       Hwidth.hwidth is 1/2 the width of the gaussian each
%                       spike in that bin is convolved with.

%% Distance to the Kth neighbor spike
